Description:
    sechm provides a simple interface between SummarizedExperiment objects and the ComplexHeatmap package.
    It enables plotting annotated heatmaps from SE objects, with easy access to rowData and colData columns, 
    and implements a number of features to make the generation of heatmaps easier and more flexible.
    These functionalities used to be part of the SEtools package.
